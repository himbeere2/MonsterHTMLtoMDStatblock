# Monster JSON to Markdown Statblock
This is a simple project to convert JSON statblocks generated by monster.pf2.tools to markdown statblocks to be used for i.e. Obsidian, written in Rust. The goal is to make it easy to add these statblocks to your notes. I don't think you can make an obisidian plugin with rust, but perhaps one day this project will be there as well! For now, the next step is copying the generated output to the clipboard, which is harder than I anticipated.

Thanks for reading, star the project if you like it!
